## Overview

Word Guess Game is a Javascript game emulating the game play of Hangman.

### How to play

* Use the keyboard to input commands

* Press any key to start: you will see the screen update with a "You are now playing" message

* Type letters to make guesses. Correct guesses will appear in the display, and incorrect guesses will deplete the number of guess's remaining.

* When all of the letters in the word have been guessed you win. When all of your guesses are depleted you lose.

* Enable hard mode to reduce the number of guesses you recieve.
